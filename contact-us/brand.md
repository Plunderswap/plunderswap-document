## Intro

PlunderSwap logo downloads are at the bottom of this page, but please be sure to read these guidelines first.

> Although PlunderSwap distributes some of its technology under open-source licenses, **the PlunderSwap brand is not distributed under the same licenses.**

The following PlunderSwap "Brand Assets" are copyrighted material, and you may only use them in accordance with the policy detailed below:

* The PlunderSwap logos, wordmark, icon
* The PlunderSwap name
* Other visual assets produced by PlunderSwap including but not limited to illustrations and 3d models

## What you may do

You may use PlunderSwap's Brand Assets when you are:

* üëå Referring to our products and services
* üëå Linking to our official site or products, such as "Trade our token on PlunderSwap"
* üëå Announcing an official partnership, but only if you have **official approval** by a qualified member of the PlunderSwap team

For information on other uses of our Brand Assets, please reach out at [Communities Group](communities.md).

## What you may not do

While we strongly believe in and follow the open source ethos, **protecting the PlunderSwap brand is extremely important for our users' security,** so that users know what is a genuine product/endorsement and what isn't.

Here are a few examples of forbidden uses of our Brand Assets:

* ‚õîÔ∏è **Don't use our Brand Assets in your products' name, logo, NFTs, etc.**&#x20;
  * For example, making an app called "PlunderSwap Engine" are not allowed.
  * Don't use the PlunderSwap logo in whole or in part as part of your products' logos, marketing material, website, or other.
  * Logos with a strong resemblence to the PlunderSwap Icon are also forbidden.
* ‚õîÔ∏è **Don't use our Brand Assets to create digital or physcial products for sale, including but not limited to**
  * Merchandise ("Swag")
  * NFTs
  * Other products
* ‚õîÔ∏è **Don't create derivative names that imply official endorsement**

    For example, don't make a social media group called "PlunderSwap Italy" - this sounds official. "PlunderSwap Fans of Italy" may be permitted.
* ‚õîÔ∏è **Don't change or adapt our Brand Assets in any way**

    Use the logos and other assets exactly as provided. Do not change the colors, reassemble, abbreviate, or change these assets in any way.

Use your common sense and creativity. If you want to make something relating to the PlunderSwap ecosystem, make it your own.

Have fun making a unique brand that's clearly yours -- if your product is strong, you won't need to rely on remixing PlunderSwap's brand.
