# Get ZIL ERC20/ZRC2 Tokens

![](../../.gitbook/assets/PS_HT_ZIL_tokens.png)

The native tokens of ZIL EVM (ZILEVM) are **ERC-20**.

NOTE: **ZRC-2** (Native ZIL Tokens) are supported via a proxy contract - Read more [!button target="blank" text="Here"](https://blog.zilliqa.com/zilliqa-evm-now-supports-fungible-scilla-tokens/)

Please see the following page for our officially created proxies for ZRC2 tokens... [**HERE**](https://docs.plunderswap.com/developers/zrc2-proxy-contracts)

To do most things on ZIL EVM, you will need to pay gas, which comes in the form of ZIL.

You will also need the ERC-20/ZRC-2 version of any token you want to trade on PlunderSwap.  You can get these from other ZIL Dexes, or from ours!

For help on tranferring ZIL or other ZRC-2 Tokens to your Zil EVM wallet, please see [**HERE**](https://docs.plunderswap.com/get-started/transfer-to-EVM)
