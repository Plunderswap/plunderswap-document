# Create a Wallet

![](../../.gitbook/assets/PS_HT_Create_Crypto_Wallet.png)

Embarking on your PlunderSwap journey requires establishing a Zilliqa EVM (ZILEVM) compatible wallet. These wallets are accessible on both desktop computers and smartphones, allowing you to select the one that aligns most suitably with your requirements.

When you're setting up a wallet, be sure to:

* Download and install only the latest version from an official source.
* Follow the setup guide carefully.
* Safely back up your recovery phrases.
* NEVER share your recovery phrases with anyone, under any circumstances.
* NEVER input your recovery phrase to a website or app, other than your wallet app.

## Mobile or Desktop wallet?

Mobile device wallets and desktop-based wallets exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses. Assessing these attributes will aid you in determining the most suitable wallet type for your requirements.

Smartphone or mobile wallets grant you the ability to access your cryptocurrency from virtually any location, compatible with both Android and iOS platforms.

Conversely, desktop wallets are accessible through your personal computer or laptop. These wallets can operate as independent applications on your device or as browser extensions, compatible with well-known browsers such as Chrome and Firefox.

NEVER, in any situation, should you ever give someone your private key or recovery phrase ("seed phrase"). This will give someone complete access to your crypto!

The genuine PlunderSwap site and staff will never ask you to input your seed phrase.
