## Seeking support

PlunderSwap doesn't have a dedicated support service.  If you find yourself tangled in a knot that hasn't been untied here, you can beckon for support at [PlunderSwap's Communities](https://docs.PlunderSwap.com/contact-us/communities). For your safety, make sure you read the notice about scams if it's your first time on channels.
