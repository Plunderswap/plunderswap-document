This FAQ page answers some of the more commonly asked questions from the PlunderSwap community.

## Is PlunderSwap safe?

See for yourself:

* Transparent:
  * We’re built on open-source software: our Smart Contracts are publicly visible for maximum transparency.

## How do I connect my wallet to ZIL EVM and PlunderSwap?

We have a [Connect Your Wallet to PlunderSwap guide](https://docs.plunderswap.com/get-started/connection-guide) covering this in detail.

## What's the best wallet for PlunderSwap?

It depends on your needs. We have an [in-depth guide to selecting and creating a wallet](https://docs.plunderswap.com/get-started/wallet-guide) that's right for you.

## Why is my transaction failing?

You can check the status of a transaction on [https://evmx.zilliqa.com/](https://evmx.zilliqa.com/).

Our [Troubleshooting Errors guide](https://docs.plunderswap.com/help/troubleshooting) may have a solution for your problem if you're having issues.

You can also see our [Fixing Stuck Pending Transactions guide](https://docs.plunderswap.com/help/unsticking-a-transaction-stuck-as-pending-with-metamask) if you have a stuck transaction.

## When will you open more pools?

New Pools are added to PlunderSwap frequently. There will always be an announcement before the launch of new pools.

## How do I get airdrops?

Whenever there is an official airdrop on PlunderSwap it will be announced along with the requirements.

Please remember anyone can airdrop tokens to PlunderSwap users since every transaction is public on EVMX. Be sure to do your own research when it comes to non-official airdrops. To protect your funds, we recommend you don't use a smart contract you don't understand from a source you don't trust.

## Where can I view smart contracts?

Learn how to find smart contracts on our [Finding Contracts page](https://docs.plunderswap.com/developers/smart-contracts).

## Why does it say I have no ZIL balance?

If you've already [transferred ZIL into your ZIL EVM-enabled wallet](https://docs.plunderswap.com/get-started/token-guide) but still have this error, you're most likely not [connected to Zilliqa EVM](https://docs.plunderswap.com/get-started/connection-guide) within your wallet. Check your wallet's selected network and make sure you have Zilliqa EVM (ZILEVM) selected.

## I can't find an answer for my question. Where do I find an answer?

If you can't find what you're looking for in PlunderSwap's documentation, ask your question on [PlunderSwap's communities](https://docs.plunderswap.com/contact-us/communities) and someone will do their best to help you out.
