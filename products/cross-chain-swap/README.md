PlunderSwap Cross-Chain Swap is a feature that allows users to swap tokens between different chains. Powered by StealthEx, it enables seamless cross-chain transactions.  Below is a guide on how to use the feature.

### Swapping/Trading

1) Click on the Cross-Chain Swap button on the home page, under the bridge section.

4) You will get a screen saying Awaiting deposit. This is where you will send the tokens (ZIL on the Zilliqa chain in my case) that you want to swap to the destination chain.  This address is specific to this exchange.  In the case of Zilliqa, the default is a ZIL1 address.  Using the little zil1/0x address convertor, you can paste in the zil1 address and find the 0x address to send the tokens to.  Copy this 0x address.

5) Send the tokens to this address using your wallet.  In ths example im using MetaMask.  Ensure you are connected to the Zilliqa chain, and click the send button. In the next screen, paste in the 0x address you copied in step 4.

10) To see the tokens on the destination chain, select the chain on the top left of metamask and you will see the tokens in your wallet.  If you do not see the tokens, add the token address for that token on that chain to your wallet.
