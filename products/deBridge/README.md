## How to bridge to Zilliqa EVM?

deBridge provides an instant, low-cost bridging solution to help you bridge any asset on any chain to any asset on the Zilliqa EVM network. Let's see how you can bridge your assets to Zilliqa EVM using an example to transfer native ETH from ETH mainnet:

1.  Visit the bridge page (e.g., [https://plunderswap.com/bridge](https://plunderswap.com/bridge)) which utilizes the deBridge widget.
2.  Select the origin chain and asset you'd like to bridge. Here, we will select Ethereum as the source chain and ETH as the asset.
3.  Next, select the destination chain and asset you'd like to receive. Here, we will select the Zilliqa EVM mainnet and USDC (address: `0xD8b73cEd1B16C047048f2c5EA42233DA33168198`) as the destination asset on the target chain.
4.  Connect your EVM wallet using the "Connect Wallet" button within the deBridge widget.
5.  Enter the quantity and review the transaction details.
6.  As the final step, confirm the trade, pay gas fees, and sign the ensuing transactions to receive crypto in your Zilliqa EVM wallet.

You'll know you've successfully bridged when you see the "Order Fulfilled" pop-up, and the bridged tokens will appear in your wallet balance directly on Zilliqa EVM. Technical users can inspect the transaction on the Zilliqa EVM explorer (e.g., Viewblock).

## First Time on Zilliqa EVM?

If you are bridging to a brand new wallet on Zilliqa EVM for the first time, you will be credited 5 ZIL for gas fees to help you get started. Make sure to visit the [PlunderSwap swap page](https://plunderswap.com/swap?inputCurrency=0xD8b73cEd1B16C047048f2c5EA42233DA33168198&outputCurrency=ZIL) to swap your newly bridged assets (USDC) for more ZIL if needed!
