### **Customize routing preferences**

At the bottom of the “Customize Routing” interface, you can customize your routing preferences by enabling or disabling multihops.

Multihops allow tokens to swap through multiple hops between serval liquidity pools to achieve the best deal. Turning it off will restrict trades to direct swaps, which may cause higher slippage or even fund loss.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When your trade can not be executed due to a customized trading configuration, a warning will appear, you can click “Check your settings” to quickly bring up the“Customize Routing” interface. Or choose “Reset to default” to quickly reset your configurations back to default.
