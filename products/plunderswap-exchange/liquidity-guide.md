"Liquidity" is central to how PlunderSwap's Exchange works. You can add liquidity for any token pair by staking both through the Liquidity page.

In return for adding liquidity, you'll receive trading fees for that pair.

4. Enter an amount on one of the tokens under “Deposit Amount”. The other should be calculated and filled automatically. If one of the tokens does not have enough balance. You will see an error and the button is greyed out. Please enter a lower amount to proceed or use the “MAX” button to fill in the maximum available value.
