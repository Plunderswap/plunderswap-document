![](../../.gitbook/assets/PS_HT_Add_Remove_liquidity.png)

"Liquidity" is central to how PlunderSwap's Exchange works. You can add liquidity for any token pair by staking both through the Liquidity page.

In return for adding liquidity, you'll receive trading fees for that pair.

## Exchange V3

To provide liquidity, you’ll need to commit an amount of any token pair you like. Your lowest value (in USD) of the two tokens will be the limit to the liquidity you can provide.

You can easily trade for any tokens you need. Visit our [How to Trade on PlunderSwap](https://docs.plunderswap.com/products/plunderswap-exchange/trade-guide/) guide if you need to.

In this example, we will add V3 liquidity using ZIL and USDC.

1 - Visit the [Liquidity](https://plunderswap.com/liquidity) page.

4 - Choose the most popular trading fee tier and configure the price range for yourself. 0.25% is the recommended setting, possibly 1% for smaller type tokens.

5 - You can confirm the version as well as the fee tier of the liquidity pool you are providing by looking for the “V3 LP - x% fee tier” displays.

* Although it is not advisable, you can provide your liquidity to the whole price range by clicking the “Full Range” button.  Just a reminder, if the price falls out of your range,
you will no longer be earning fees for that period of time.

7 - Enter an amount on one of the tokens under “Deposit Amount”. The other should be calculated and filled automatically. If one of the tokens does not have enough balance. You will see an error and the button is greyed out. Please enter a lower amount to proceed or use the “MAX” button to fill in the maximum available value.
