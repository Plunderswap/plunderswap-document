# Liquidity Pools

## Exchange V2

### LP Tokens

As an example, if you deposited **ZIL** and **ZUSDT** into a Liquidity Pool, you'd receive **ZIL-ZUSDT LP** tokens.

The number of LP tokens you receive represents your portion of the ZIL-ZUSDT Liquidity Pool.

You can also redeem your funds at any time by removing your liquidity.

### **Earning trading fees**

Whenever someone trades on PlunderSwap, for each hop (swap) in each liquidity pool, the trader pays a fixed 0.35% fee, **of which 0.20%** is added back to the Liquidity Pool in a form of trading fees.  The remaining 0.15% fee is sent to the Plunderswap treasury to keep the vessel sailing smoothly into the future!

## Impermanent Loss

Providing liquidity is not without risk, as you may be exposed to impermanent loss.

[“Simply put, impermanent loss is the difference between holding tokens in an AMM and holding them in your wallet.” - Nate Hindman](https://blog.bancor.network/beginners-guide-to-getting-rekt-by-impermanent-loss-7c9510cb2f22)
