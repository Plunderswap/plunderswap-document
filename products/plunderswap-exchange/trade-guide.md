Engaging in trading on PlunderSwap is notably simpler compared to the majority of exchanges. You won't encounter an inundation of complex charts or terminology. The PlunderSwap Smart Router adeptly manages trading routes and computations on your behalf.

You will also need to have some Zil ERC-20 tokens, or (via proxy) ZRC-2 tokens to trade with. You can learn how to get some [here](https://docs.plunderswap.com/get-started/token-guide).
