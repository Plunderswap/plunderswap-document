Plunderswap Prediction is a fun and simple decentralized prediction market.

> ## Predict whether $ZIL price will rise or fall – guess correctly to win

It's easy to take part:

* Predict if the price of ZILUSD  will be higher or lower than it was when the “LIVE” phase starts.
* If you enter an “UP” position, and the “Closed Price” is higher than the “Locked Price” at the end of the 5 minute LIVE phase, you WIN! And if it’s lower, you lose.
* If you enter a “DOWN” position, and the “Closed Price” is higher than the “Locked Price” at the end of the 5 minute LIVE phase, you LOSE! If it’s lower, you win.

Have fun!
