The Protocol was initially deployed on the Zilliqa blockchain.. Deployments on other networks typically make use of cross-chain bridges, which allow assets native to one blockchain to be transferred to another blockchain. Please note that digital assets that have been \"bridged\" or \"wrapped\" to operate on other blockchain networks (including to blockchains compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine that are designed to ensure the Ethereum blockchain can effectively process more transactions or other blockchains that are frequently referred to as \"Layer 2\" solutions) are distinct from the original Zilliqa mainnet asset.","To access the Interface, you must use a non-custodial wallet software, which allows you to interact with public blockchains. Your relationship with that non-custodial wallet provider is governed by the applicable terms of service (with respect to the PlunderSwap Wallet, this Agreement, and with respect to a third party wallet, the applicable terms of service of such third party). We do not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and have no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. By connecting your wallet to our Interface, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and all of the terms incorporated herein by reference."]},{"i":"12-the-nft-marketplace-aggregator","l":"1.2 The NFT Marketplace Aggregator","p":["The NFT Marketplace Aggregator is a series of smart contracts that allows you to discover, buy, and sell NFTs simultaneously across multiple third-party marketplaces (each a \"Third-Party Marketplace\").","The NFT Marketplace Aggregator enables transactions involving NFTs that are listed on Third-Party Marketplaces.
