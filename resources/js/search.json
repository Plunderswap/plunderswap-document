In many cases, the transaction cannot meet the input and output requirements because of the tax.","Swapping with Transaction Fees","Before you swap any tokens, make sure you have visited their website to understand if they have a transaction fee mechanism (or tax as many projects put it). If there is, make sure you set a slippage that is sufficient to accommodate the transaction fee -- e.g. if there is a transaction fee of 5%, your slippage will have to be set at at least 5% plus the normal trading slippage depending on your trading amount and the token's liquidity, say 5.5%-6%.","In some extreme cases including some scams, some tokens even have a block on most or all transfers on chain, or only allowing certain addresses to sell, in such case it is impossible to swap the token successfully.
